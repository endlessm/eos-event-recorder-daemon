 * @title: Event Recorder
 * @short_description: Records metric events to metric system daemon.
 * @include: eosmetrics/eosmetrics.h
 *
 * The event recorder asynchronously sends metric events to the metric system
 * daemon via D-Bus. The system daemon then delivers metrics to the server on
 * a best-effort basis. No feedback is given regarding the outcome of delivery.
 * The event recorder is thread-safe.
 *
 * This API may be called from JavaScript as follows.

 * @key: (allow-none) (in): the identifier used to associate the start of the
 * event with the stop and any progress
 * @auxiliary_payload: (allow-none) (in): miscellaneous data to associate with
 * the events
 *
 * Make a best-effort to record the fact that an event of type @event_id
 * started at the current time. The event's stop must be reported using
 * emtr_event_recorder_record_stop() or memory will be leaked.
 * emtr-event-types.h is the registry for event IDs. If starts and stops of
 * events of type @event_id can be nested, then @key should be used to
 * disambiguate the stop and any progress that corresponds to this start. For
 * example, if one were recording how long processes remained open, process IDs
 * would be a suitable choice for the @key. Within the lifetime of each process,
 * process IDs are unique within the scope of PROCESS_OPEN events. If starts and
 * stops of events of type @event_id can not be nested, then @key can be %NULL.
 *
 * Optionally, associate arbitrary data, @auxiliary_payload, with this
 * particular instance of the event. Under no circumstances should
 * personally-identifiable information be included in the @auxiliary_payload or
 * @event_id. Large auxiliary payloads dominate the size of the event and should
 * therefore be used sparingly. Events for which precise timing information is
 * not required should instead be recorded using
 * emtr_event_recorder_record_events() to conserve bandwidth.
 *
 * At the discretion of the metrics system, the event may be discarded before
 * being reported to the metrics server. However, an event start, the
 * corresponding stop, and any corresponding progress either will be delivered or
 * dropped atomically. The event may take arbitrarily long to reach the server
 * and may be persisted unencrypted on the client for arbitrarily long. There is
 * no guarantee that the event is delivered via the network; for example, it may
 * instead be delivered manually on a USB drive. No indication of successful or
 * failed delivery is provided, and no application should rely on successful
 * delivery. The event will not be aggregated with other events before reaching
 * the server.
